(* Project language file 1
* For: seanpm2001/Learn-ML
* About:
* I decided to make ML the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-ML) as ML is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the ML programming language. It only makes sense to ML the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
